## Description
Function that takes 2 dimensional coordinates for the movements of particles in a particular resolution setting and converts it to a mean square displacement calculator based upon given time steps (dt). Original codebase is in R but was translated to C++ for improved complexity time and memory effeciency. Relies upon the Armadillo C++ package.
